# InvestmentDataTerminal
This project, written in Python, allows the user to display live quotes of investments right in the terminal. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this tool is to be able to check your investments with the minimal effort possible. Hence, I created a tool of which you only have to adjust a config.txt file and run the script in a terminal. The outcome is a table that shows you the daily development of your investments.
